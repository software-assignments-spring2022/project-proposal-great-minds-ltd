# Project Proposal
### Project title
Ev.where
### Team
Mateus Aragão, Shrey Mittal
### What and why?
EV.where is an application in which users with electric vehicles can route trips with optimizations on a variety of fronts.

The closest current version of this software is in cars like Tesla, which have route planning features that make sure you do not run out of charge and show if your car is capable of traveling a certain distance without running out of battery. This software greatly expands upon this feature. Firstly, it synchronizes across multiple automaker’s and EV network’s services. As of right now, companies like Ford have partnerships with EV charging networks that restrict the route planning feature to their stations. Along with this, certain electric vehicles lack access to these route planning features, either due to their vehicle having a lower cost or smaller companies unable to form partnerships with large EV consortiums. This system will solve both problems at once, by linking all users across different EV platforms at once. This will allow for more complex routes across a wide range of charging stations. The service will also let you choose how to optimize the route based on the least cost, time, or network. Finally, if there is time for implementation, the service will also generate partnerships with local businesses to offer discounts to riders while they wait for their car to charge. This can offer a potential revenue stream for the app. Along with this a 
a rewards system can be generated in-app for another form of revenue.

### For whom?
The main target of this app is people who own electric vehicles. It can specifically benefit those who purchase vehicles without comprehensive software to plan out routes, or vehicles that are locked into a specific EV charging network. This app is essentially a segway from apps like GasBuddy, as it allows mass comparison of electricity prices, while also having the route optimization feature for, say, people who are going on road trips. This can also be deployed on a commercial level to manage corporate EV fleets.

### How?
In the first use of the app, the users will be asked to register their electrical vehicle. The vehicle information helps us create better routes depending on the specification of the car. Users may be able to register multiple vehicles in the app. But the navigation tab will be tailored for each specific vehicle specification. Users input their destinations once in the navigation tab and the app will render different possible routes. Each route offers pros and cons. Then the client chooses the preferred route and starts their journey. 


### Scope
Our product is not too ambitious since we have a very specific goal, which keeps the team focused on fundamental features that make the app possible. It is not an easy project given that we will have to use 1 or 2 APIs(Chargetrip and NREL’s) for the project to be fully functional. Successfully implementing such an API will enable us to knock out most of the complex features of the app such as the routing algorithm and countrywide EV charging network.
